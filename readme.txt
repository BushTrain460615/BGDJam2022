Where Visions Overlap

Two daring adventurers seek out to Cave Ledatta, a cave known to hold mysterious magics.
They have their own reason to go, and they have their own paths, too.
And this is where their visions overlap...

Hello! We are Basement Dwellers, a two-man team consists of me (sqirra-rng) and Izzy.
This is a game made for BGDJam 2022, a game jam initiated by UKM BGDC BINUS University.
This is also a very short game and can be finished around 15 minutes.
Sit back and we hope you enjoyed the game :)

P.S. This was *mostly* made in a hurry, I soon realized it was not a good idea to
challenge myself by programming this game in C...
